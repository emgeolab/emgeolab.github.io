    <h2 id="-exciting-news-nserc-discovery-grant-awarded">🎉 Exciting News: NSERC Discovery Grant Awarded</h2>
<p>I’m very happy to share that I have received my <strong>first NSERC Discovery Grant</strong> as an Early Career Researcher.</p>
<p>This support marks an important milestone as I begin my faculty career at the <strong>University of Manitoba</strong>, and I’m deeply grateful for the confidence NSERC has placed in my research program.</p>
<hr />
<h3>🔍 Research Overview</h3>
<p>The funded research program, <strong><em>“Advancing electromagnetic geophysics for exploration and sustainable management of mineral resources,”</em></strong>, focuses on developing new electromagnetic (EM) geophysical approaches to better image the Earth’s subsurface.</p>
<p>The main goals of the program are to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Develop <strong>next-generation EM survey designs</strong>, including 3D and distributed sensor systems</li>
<li>Improve subsurface imaging by advancing our understanding of <strong>frequency-dependent conductivity and chargeability</strong></li>
<li>Create <strong>scalable computational methods</strong> for simulation and inversion of large EM datasets</li>
<li>Support <strong>sustainable and responsible mineral exploration</strong>, particularly for critical minerals needed for the energy transition</li>
</ul>
<p>This work builds on my previous research in airborne EM, induced polarization, and large-scale inversion, with a strong emphasis on open-source software development and open science.</p>
<hr />
<h3>🇨🇦 Why This Matters</h3>
<p>As demand for critical minerals such as nickel and copper continues to grow, Canada faces the challenge of discovering new resources while minimizing environmental impact.</p>
<p>By advancing EM geophysics, this research aims to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improve detection and characterization of deep and complex mineral systems</li>
<li>Reduce exploration risk and uncertainty</li>
<li>Support data-driven, sustainable resource management</li>
</ul>
<p>The outcomes of this work will help strengthen Canada’s capacity in mineral exploration while contributing to broader societal goals around sustainability.</p>
<hr />
<h3>🎓 Training and Mentorship</h3>
<p>A key component of this grant is the training of <strong>highly qualified personnel (HQP)</strong>. Over the next five years, this program will support graduate students and postdoctoral researchers working at the intersection of geophysics, computation, and data science.</p>
<p>I’m especially excited to build an inclusive research environment and to mentor students as they develop skills that are valuable across academia, industry, and the public sector.</p>
<hr />
<h3>🙏 Acknowledgements</h3>
<p>I’m sincerely thankful to NSERC for this support, and to my mentors, collaborators, and colleagues who have contributed to shaping this research direction.</p>
<p>I’m excited to get started and to share updates as the research progresses.</p>

<!-- In August 2019, I started a new position as Lecturer in Geophysics at the
[University of Liverpool](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/earth-ocean-and-ecological-sciences/).
As part of this transition, I've had to think about my research in a broader context and
analyse what sets it apart.
Since the lab's research will mainly focus on method development,
the range of actual scientific applications that we could potentially work on is broad.
Unfortunately, this makes coming up with a lab name rather difficult.

The constant thing throughout my career has been the fact that "computational thinking"
is at the heart of everything I do:
from potential-field inversion to
forward modeling.
After much brainstorming, *"Computer-Oriented Geoscience"* seems to accurately describe
the type of research we do here:
**we apply computational methods to solve problems in geoscience**.

As a direct consequence, we also develop and maintain
several open-source projects that supports our research and implement the
methods that we develop.
Our language of choice is Python and we have years of expertise in modern and
collaborative software development.
We are a small group at the moment (only 2 members) but I'm hoping to grow
with time.

We are eager to establish collaborations with applied scientists who have interesting
problems that could benefit from our computational and numerical modeling skills.
